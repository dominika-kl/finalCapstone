        <p>I am Dominika and this is my dog Milo. We are passionate about travelling. Let me introduce you to my favourite travel companion - my dog! We started going on trips when he was just a puppy. We travelled across France, we visited Black Forest in Germany, we had a stop in Amsterdam. We went skiing in the French Alps, spent many summers in Poland, went for short and long road trips in England, Scotland and Wales, but the real adventure was waiting for us across the Atlantic Ocean. We had a chance to spend a few years in Canada, where we travelled across Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward's Island. While looking for sun, we went South. From Montreal down to Key West along the East Coast. Most of the time travelling by car, but also by plane and ferry. If you'd like to find out more about our trips, explore our website!</p>

        <h2>Useful links</h2>
        <p>When planning your trip abroad, the first step you should take is visiting the official government websites for all the information about required documentation for your dog (passport, vacinations, health certificate etc.). In some cases you need take some actions couple of weeks prior to you departure. These are some useful links:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-your-pet-abroad">Travelling with pets from/to the UK</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/news/airline-pet-fees">Flying with pets, airline policies, fees</a></li>
